* Unlocks the skip function for any track

## **Download and Usage:**
* Download the code **[here](https://github.com/R3nzTheCodeGOD/Spotify-Internal/releases)**
* If the dll and `installer.bat` are in the same directory, run installer.bat and if you get the successful message everything is ok

## How can i disable it ?
* You can disable it with `uinstaller.bat`, if there is a problem, delete `chrome_elf.dll` in `%appdata%/Spotify/` folder and remove the leading underscore from `_chrome_elf.dll`
